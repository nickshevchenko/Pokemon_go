## Pokemon GO

####This application is a client for [Pokemon API](http://pokeapi.co) to view info about each pokemon available in the base.
####The best way to run the app is to use github pages via the current [link](http://nickshevchenko.github.io/Pokemon_go/)

####On click on Pokemon card a new Pokemon view will be opened for the selected Pokemon. This view contains more detailed info about selected Pokemon' abilities.

#####Hope you'll enjoy the app! For more details, please contact me via email: nick.shevchyenko@gmail.com
######Currently I'm working on adding a filter for Pokemons types, adaptive stype and js improvements such as making the code satisfied to ECMAScript 6 requirements.
